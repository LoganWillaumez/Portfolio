# Portfolio

This is my Portfolio. For this project, I tried to incorporate what represents me.

As a learning opportunity, I used Next.js (really impressive to play with).

Three.js (using threefiber) was added to the about page. It was my intention to show my "before and after" Web development discovery, and why I wanted to change.

Feel free to contact me via the form.

## Stack

- Next.js
- MUI
- Three.js/ThreeFiber.js

Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed Node.js â‰¥ 12

1. Install dependencies :

2. Configure .env.local

It used EmailJS. Feel free to check with your own variables.

3. To launch locally :

More feedback on the loaded elements (like images), even if it's quick with Next.js.
